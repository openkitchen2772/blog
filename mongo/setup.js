Each component has its own logic and controls its own rendering, and can be reused wherever you need them.\n\n Code re-use helps make your apps easier to develop and easier to maintain. They also help you implement a consistent look and feel across the whole project.\n\n This may be a short description, but using components provides a large advantage in your development efforts.' });

db.posts.insert({ title: '[Golang] About panic() and fatal()', time: 'Tue Mar 9 2021', content: 'panic is often used in little programs to just terminate the program once an error appears you don\'t know how to handle or don\'t want to handle.\n\n The downside of panic is exactly that: it\'ll terminate the program (mostly, unless you use recover). It\'s generally not good to use panic unless you intend to recover from it or unless something has happened you really can\'t recover from at all nor where you can gracefully terminate the program otherwise.\n\n Consider for example an API that offers you functionality but that API secretly has a panic somewhere and you notice that your program terminates in production due to this. Thus, the "outward API" of whatever code you write should recover from panics and return an error instead. The same thing applies to anything that terminates the program.' });
